Gary and Paul O'Donovan from Skibbereen. Olympic 金牌获得者. How does it feel? It's fantastic. 我们还没有太多鸡蛋来接受这一个事实. We wanted to win the 金牌 and come over with a 银牌. Like we're just so 开心. We can't complain with that. Paul Go 对我来说就是 as fast as you can and 拉 like a dog. 第四 at 500. 第四 at 1000. You 拉得非常用力 in that 最后阶段 of that race. We did. Josh 我们有点那么失望我们没能带回 金牌. I think we 把它交给 the French as best we could and we 冲到接近终点 there at the end. I'd say 我们整个车道都在跑, but we're 害怕回家了 now 因为 Mick Conlan 说他会打我们如果我们没能拿到 金牌.
